## Introduction

This report covers the complete implementation of training a custom Word2Vec model from scratch. Word2Vec is a neural network model that learns word representations (embeddings) by analyzing the relationships between words in text data.

### Why Train Our Own Model?

- **Domain-Specific**: Captures specialized vocabulary from our specific field
- **Custom Control**: Full control over training parameters and data quality
- **Privacy**: No need to rely on external pre-trained models
- **Learning**: Better understanding of how Word2Vec works internally

### Two Main Approaches

1. **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**
   - Input: Context words → Output: Center word
   - Example: ["the", "cat", "on", "mat"] → "sat"
   - Faster training, good for frequent words

2. **Skip-gram**
   - Input: Center word → Output: Context words
   - Example: "sat" → ["the", "cat", "on", "mat"]
   - Better for rare words and semantic relationships

## Setup and Prerequisites

### Required Libraries
```python
# Core libraries
import os
import re
import string
import time
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np

# NLTK for text processing
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

# Gensim for Word2Vec
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from gensim.models.callbacks import CallbackAny2Vec

# Evaluation libraries
from scipy.stats import spearmanr
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
```

### Working Directory Setup
```python
ROOT = "/content/drive/MyDrive/CST/SWE_Notebook/Year3Sem1/DAM_202"
os.chdir(ROOT)
```

---

## Data Preparation

### Loading Text Data
```python
with open('text.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    texts = f.readlines()
```

### Data Quality Assessment

We implemented a comprehensive data quality checker that analyzes:

- **Total documents**: Number of text entries
- **Vocabulary size**: Number of unique words
- **Average sentence length**: Words per sentence
- **Word frequency distribution**: Most common words
- **Quality indicators**: Vocabulary diversity, rare word ratio

**Key Functions:**
- `assess_data_quality()`: Analyzes corpus statistics
- Returns vocabulary size, word frequencies, and quality metrics

**Sample Output:**
```
Total documents: 1,250
Vocabulary size: 8,439
Average sentence length: 12.3
Vocabulary diversity: 0.0142
```

## Text Preprocessing

### Advanced Text Preprocessing Pipeline

We created a comprehensive `AdvancedTextPreprocessor` class with the following features:

#### Cleaning Options:
- **Lowercase conversion**: Normalize text case
- **Punctuation removal**: Clean special characters
- **Number handling**: Remove or keep numeric values
- **URL/Email removal**: Clean web-specific content
- **Stopword filtering**: Remove common words (optional)
- **Word length filtering**: Remove very short/long words
- **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to root forms

#### Key Parameters:
```python
preprocessor = AdvancedTextPreprocessor(
    lowercase=True,
    remove_punctuation=True,
    remove_numbers=True,
    remove_stopwords=False,  # Keep for Word2Vec
    lemmatize=False,         # Usually not needed
    keep_sentences=True
)
```

#### Processing Results:
- **Input**: Raw text with punctuation, URLs, mixed case
- **Output**: Clean tokenized sentences ready for training

**Sample Before/After:**
- Before: "Hello World! Visit https://example.com for more info."
- After: ["hello", "world", "visit", "for", "more", "info"]

## Model Training

### Parameter Selection Strategy

We implemented an intelligent parameter recommendation system:

```python
def recommend_parameters(corpus_size, vocab_size, domain_type, computing_resources):
```

#### Parameter Guidelines:

**Vector Size** (Embedding dimensions):
- Small corpus (< 10K): 50 dimensions
- Medium corpus (< 100K): 100 dimensions  
- Large corpus (< 1M): 200 dimensions
- Very large corpus (> 1M): 300 dimensions

**Window Size** (Context words):
- Technical domains: 3 (focus on syntax)
- General text: 5 (balanced)
- Academic text: 6 (focus on semantics)

**Algorithm Selection**:
- Skip-gram (sg=1): Better for rare words, technical terms
- CBOW (sg=0): Faster training, better for frequent words

### Training Implementation

```python
# Recommended parameters for our corpus
params = recommend_parameters(
    corpus_size=len(processed_sentences),
    vocab_size=vocab_size,
    domain_type='general',
    computing_resources='moderate'
)
```

**Final Training Parameters:**
- Vector size: 50
- Window: 2
- Min count: 2
- Epochs: 10,000
- Algorithm: CBOW

### Training Progress Monitoring

We implemented `EpochLogger` to track training progress:
- Real-time epoch monitoring
- Training time tracking
- Progress callbacks

**Sample Training Output:**
```

  vector_size: 150
  window: 1
  min_count: 1
  epochs: 50

Epoch #0 start
Epoch #0 end - Time elapsed: 2.45s
...
Training completed in 245.67 seconds
Vocabulary size: 1,423 words
```

## Model Evaluation

### Comprehensive Evaluation Suite

We implemented the `Word2VecEvaluator` class with multiple evaluation methods:

#### 1. Word Similarity Evaluation
- Tests model against human similarity judgments
- Uses Spearman correlation coefficient
- Example pairs: (king, queen, 8.5), (car, automobile, 9.2)

#### 2. Word Analogy Testing
- Tests reasoning: "king is to queen as man is to ?"
- Measures accuracy on analogy tasks
- Example: king - man + woman = queen

#### 3. Vocabulary Coverage Analysis
- Measures how well model covers test texts
- Identifies unknown words
- Calculates coverage ratios

#### 4. Model Comparison
- Compares with baseline models
- Analyzes similarity patterns
- Provides correlation metrics

### Sample Evaluation Results

**Word Similarity Test:**
```python
word_similarity_pairs = [
    ('king', 'queen', 8.5),
    ('man', 'woman', 8.3),
    ('car', 'automobile', 9.2),
    ('computer', 'laptop', 7.8),
    ('cat', 'dog', 6.1),
    ('happy', 'sad', 2.1),
]
```

**Analogy Test:**
```python
analogy_examples = [
    ('king', 'queen', 'man', 'woman'),
    ('paris', 'france', 'london', 'england'),
    ('walking', 'walked', 'running', 'ran'),
]
```

## Results and Analysis

### Model Performance

**Vocabulary Statistics:**
- Final vocabulary size: 1,423 unique words

word = "alice"
similar_words = model.wv.most_similar(word, topn=10)

# Sample output:
# alice: 1.0000
# rabbit: 0.8234
# wonderland: 0.7891
# queen: 0.7456
```

**Similarity Calculations:**
```python
similarity = model.wv.similarity('king', 'man')
# Output: 0.6234 (on scale 0-1)
```

## Screenshots Note

#### Reasons for Low Accuracy

The analogy dataset I used was very small, with only four examples. Because of this, the accuracy appears unstable. For instance, only one correct prediction out of four gives an accuracy of 0.25, but if one more was correct, it would already jump to 0.5.

The training corpus I used might have been too limited. With fewer sentences, the Word2Vec model could not learn strong embeddings. This affected words like king, queen, and alice, which may not have appeared often enough to build meaningful relationships.

The parameters I applied were not optimal. The vector size of 50 might be too small to capture deeper relationships. Also, setting the window size to 2 could have limited the context available to the model. Additionally, I trained the model with 10,000 epochs, which may have caused overfitting instead of generalization.

There was also the possibility of noise in the dataset. If the corpus contained irrelevant or random text, it would have weakened the quality of the embeddings and reduced analogy accuracy.
